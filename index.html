        <p>Welcome to the MadeOf Physics Engine wiki. For information MadeOf is an abandoned project</p>
        <p>MadeOf is a physics engine programmed in java by betot , its made for adding physics to a java project easily</p>
        <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

        <h3>Get Started</h3>
        <p>for using MadeOf you need to download the .jar down below</p>
        <p>(Jar is lost and project too , but there is the link for the source code <a
           href="https://github.com/editor4001/MadeOfEngine" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>

    <h1>About MadeOf</h1>
    <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p><strong>MadeOf</strong> is a lightweight 2D physics engine created in Java. 
       It is designed to make adding realistic physics to small Java projects simple and fun.</p>

    <h3>What it does</h3>
    <p>MadeOf simulates basic physics behaviors such as gravity, collisions, and friction. 
       You can create balls that move naturally, collide, and interact with each other, 
       or draggable objects that users can manipulate with the mouse.</p>

    <h3>Why it exists</h3>
    <p>The engine was built as a personal learning project to understand how physics simulations work in Java. 
       It’s a playful tool for experimenting with motion, collisions, and interactive elements.</p>

    <h3>Who it's for</h3>
    <p>MadeOf is perfect for hobby projects, educational purposes, or anyone curious about physics programming in Java. 
       It’s simple to integrate, and you can modify it freely to explore new physics concepts.</p>
